### DrawStringTest

### GetMessageTest

Then it goes straight again. This behaviour is done over a loop.

### LedsTest
The leds are tests setting them on different colors every half second.

If the robot captures dark light, it rotates. Otherwise, it goes straight. 

### LineFollowTest
The robot tries to follow a black line.

### SendMessageTest
The robot sends a message using its infrared sensor, then plays a sound.
